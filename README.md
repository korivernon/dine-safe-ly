# Assignment 1

## Introduction

>  I am running into issues deploying my code.
- I have followed this tutorial (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python?singlepage=true#introduction) in order to try to get my instance running, however I was running into issues when I was trying to run the command `heroku ps:scale web=1 `. This plagued me for the entirety of the assignment:

## Code Samples


```
 ➜ heroku ps:scale web=1
Scaling dynos... !
 ▸    Couldn't find that process type (web).
```
- To try to resolve this issue, I have looked to several stack overflow forums (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48512013/couldnt-find-that-process-type-heroku) in which they suggested `deleting Procfile`, removing and reinstalling buildpacks. Nothing seemed to resolve the issue...
- I have installed the requisite heroku buildpacks,
```
Buildpack added. Next release on damp-headland-14639 will use:
  1. heroku/python
  2. heroku-community/apt
  3. https://github.com/heroku/heroku-geo-buildpack.git
```

When trying to create a superuser using: `heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser`, it says that the file `manage.py` does not exist. Furthermore, when trying to push any changes at all to `develop:master`, I am given this:
```
! [remote rejected] develop -> master (pre-receive hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.heroku.com/damp-headland-14639.git'
``
